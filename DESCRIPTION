Description: Neighbor-seq identifies physical cell interactions by using a machine learning classifier that annotates the cellular composition of each scRNA-seq barcode. scRNA-seq data is filtered to remove low quality cells, the remaining barcodes are clustered based on their gene expression, and cluster marker genes are identified. A vast majority of the barcodes typically represent genuine single cells, with a minority being doublets or multiplets. A training set of artificial multiplets is constructed representing all possible multiplet types by randomly sampling cells from each cell cluster and aggregating their raw read counts. The artificial multiplets can be homotypic (same cell-type) or heterotypic (different cell-type) and can be of order 2 (e.g. AA, AB, BB etc.) or higher (e.g. AAA, ABA, etc.). A Random Forest cell-type classifier is trained based on the expression of marker gene sets from n (default: 100) randomly sampled barcodes from each artificial multiplet type, as well as n barcodes from each original cell type cluster, which are predominantly singlets. Neighbor-seq then applies the classifier to annotate each barcode in the original dataset and identifies those classified as multiplets. An ensemble annotation result is generated by iterating the algorithm. Neighbor-seq computes the enrichment and corresponding statistical significance of the observed frequencies of multiplet types compared to that expected based on the prevalence of the original cell-types in the dataset. Accordingly, Neighbor-seq constructs a network representing significant cell-type interactions and enables transcriptomic analysis of interacting cells.
